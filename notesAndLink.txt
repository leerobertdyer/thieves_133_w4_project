NOTES
    I think I've accomplished the fixes you brought up. But still unsure.

    Here's the notes from before:

     I am still having trouble understanding the relationship lines from table to table. 
     I get what they mean, and which ones to use (for the most part)
     But I don't understand why we are using them.
     I spent more time deciding which ends to put on the lines than on any other part of the project

     I also still struggle a bit with the Primary and Foreign Key use. I tried to keep them at a minimal after watching your video,
     But it's hard to trust that you'll be able to access them through a variety of joins. 
     I'm sure that I'll get used to this over time.
