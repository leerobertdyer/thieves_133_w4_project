Week 4 - ERD Assignment

USE ERD to Create SQL Database 

Car Dealership
Create an ERD for a car dealership. The dealership sells both new and used cars, and it operates a service facility. Base your design on the following business rules:



A SALESPERSON may sell many cars, but each car is sold by only one salesperson.
A CUSRTOMER may buy many cars, but each car is purchased by only one customer.
A salesperson writes a single INVOICE for each car he or she sells
A customer gets an invoice for each car he or she buys.
A customer may come in just to have his or her car serviced; 
        that is, a customer need not buy a car to be classified as a customer.
When a customer takes one or more cars in for repair or service, 
        one SERVICE TICKET is written for each car
The car dealership maintains a SERVICE HISTORY for each of the cars serviced. The service records are referenced by the carâ€™s serial number.
A car brought in for service can be worked on by many mechanics, and each MECHANIC may work on many cars.

After the tables have been created, use SQL to add data to the database
Each person will need to create their own SQL database.
